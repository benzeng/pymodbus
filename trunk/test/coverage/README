# Code Coverage Testing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------# 
Code coverage is a measure used in software testing. It describes the degree
to which the source code of a program has been tested. It is a form of
testing that inspects the code directly and is therefore a form of white box
testing. Currently, the use of code coverage is extended to the field of
digital hardware, the contemporary design methodology of which relies on
Hardware description languages (HDLs).

# Tools
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------# 
coverage.py
	Measures code coverage during Python execution; uses the code analysis
	tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard library to
	determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed

figleaf
	Figleaf is a Python code coverage analysis tool, built somewhat on the
	model of Ned Batchelder's fantastic coverage module. The goals of figleaf
	are to be a minimal replacement of 'coverage.py' that supports more
	configurable coverage gathering and reporting; figleaf is useful for
	situations where you are recording code coverage in multiple execution
	runs and/or want to tweak the reporting output

trace2html
	HTML test coverage reporting tool with white and blacklisting support

coverage fiber
	The coverage fiber weaves monitoring commands, so called sensors, into
	source code during global source transformation. When a statement is
	covered the weaved sensor responds. The coverage fiber is part of EasyExtend

pry
	Elegant unit testing framework with built-in coverage analysis,
	profiling, micro-benchmarking and a powerful command-line interface.
