# Fuzz Testing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------# 
"fuzz testing" (or "fuzzing") is a software testing technique whose basic idea
is to attach the inputs of a program to a source of random data ("fuzz"). If the
program fails (for example, by crashing, or by failing built-in code assertions),
then there are defects to correct. The great advantage of fuzz testing is that
the test design is extremely simple, and free of preconceptions about system behavior.

Pester
	Tests your tests by mutating source code and finding tests that don't fail!

Peach Fuzzer Framework
	Peach can fuzz just about anything from .NET, COM/ActiveX, SQL, shared
	libraries/DLL's, network applications, web, you name it.

antiparser
	The purpose of antiparser is to provide an API that can be used to model
	network protocols and file formats by their composite data types. Once a
	model has been created, the antiparser has various methods for creating
	random sets of data that deviates in ways that will ideally trigger
	software bugs or security vulnerabilities.
